## Project Mission Statement & Project Overview
  The ARRC Computer Science Repository is an organization with a focus on providing new 
  and old coders with a wider branch of skills with a focus on graphic and physical engines. 
  Every 4 - 6 months, large group projects are activated via the official discord, at which projects
  are broken apart into small subsects 
## File Structure
  The tri/bi annual projects are denoted in the following format: [PROJECT_TITLE].[DATE_START].[DATE_END].[PROJECT_ADMIN].
  The folders for this can be found in the repository <a href="https://github.com/Uhnji/ARCC_CSCI_REPO">main page</a>. 
  Each individual project will have a specialized Dev Doc, which will be moderated by the assigned project admin. This document
  will be listed in the specific project file, and functions will be definec within this, alongisde any project-specific licenses or instructions.
  Code files will be denoted in the [PRIMARY_PROJECT].[FILE_ID_CODE].[DATE_RELEASED].[UPLOADER].[FORKED/NOT]. File IDs are announced at the start of 
  projects, and are how project assignments are broken out. Standard codes are 3 letters shown in the table below (x's are blank characters).
  |Character|  Use  |
  |---------|-------|
  |Mxx|Module file, to be added to primary via import or standard implementation.|
